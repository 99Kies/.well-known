      <p>
        Making it possible to connect existing systems and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) is an important undertaking that can aid in bootstrapping adoption and usefulness of DIDs. One such form of connection is the ability of a DID controller to prove they are the same entity that controls an Internet domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DID Configuration resource provides proof of a bi-directional relationship between the controller of an Internet domain and a DID via cryptographically verifiable signatures that are linked to a DID's key material. This document describes the data format of the resource and the resource location at which Internet domain controllers can publish their DID Configuration.

        DID Configuration is a draft specification being developed within the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), and intended for registration with IANA as a Well-Known resource. This spec will be updated to reflect relevant changes, and participants are encouraged to contribute at the following repository location: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/.well-known">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/.well-known</a>

      <h2>Resource Location</h2>
      <p>
        The DID Configuration resource MUST exist at the domain root, in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615">IETF 8615 Well-Known Resource</a> directory, as follows: `/.well-known/did-configuration` 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="resource_definition">
      <h2>Resource Definition</h2>
      <p>
        The DID Configuration resource is a JSON object containing references to DIDs, paired with cryptographically verifiable signatures from their associated keys. The resource MUST NOT exceed 8 kilobytes in total size.
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>

<div class="example">
<code><pre>
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "did": "did:btcr:123...",
      "jwt": "ewogICJAY29udGV4dCI..."

      "jwt": "uC75Xsdcgbd73Cdeqc8..."
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
</div>
      
      <h3>Properties and Values</h3>
      <p>
        The top-level object MUST be a JSON object with the list of DID linkage assertions included under the `entries` field, wherein each entry is a DID the domain owner is claiming to control. Each entry MUST contain the following properties and values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          `entries` - An array of domain linkage assertion objects
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Domain Linkage Assertions</h4>
      <p>
      Each DID linkage asserting under the `entries` property of the resource's top-level JWT object MUST contain the following properties and values:

      <ul>
          <li>
            `did` - MUST be present, and the DID string MUST match the DID string specified in the `iss` property of the assertion's decoded `jwt` value
          </li>

          <li>
            `jwt` - MUST be present, and MUST be a JWT signed by the keys currently associated with the specified DID. The JWT assertion defines the following sub-properties:
            <ul>
              <li>
                `iss` - MUST be present, and MUST be a DID string that matches the DID string asserted in the DID Entry Object.
              </li>
              <li>
                `domain` - MUST be present, and MUST match the domain the DID Configuration resource is located at
              </li>
              <li>
                `exp` - SHOULD be defined to indicate a time after which the assertion of domain linkage MUST NOT be deemed valid
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="resource_validation">
      <h2>Resource Fetch and Validation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Given a domain, `example.com`, fetch the DID Configuration resource via a GET request over secure HTTP connection (`https`) to the well-known location: `https://example.com/.well-known/did-configuration`
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided the call returns a successful response, ensure the body is no larger than 8 kilobytes in size
        </li>
        <li>
          Parse the body as JSON in accordance with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259">IETF RFC 8259</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Validation of Domain Linkage Assertions</h2>
        <p>
          After fetching and validating the resource in accordance with the steps enumerated in the <a href="#resource_validation">Resource Fetch and Validation</a> section above, process Domain Linkage Assertions as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The assertion object MUST contain the property `did`, and the value MUST be a valid <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#generic-did-syntax">DID URI</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The assertion object MUST contain the property `jwt`, and the value MUST be a Base64 string that decodes to a valid JWT
          </li>
          <li>
            The JWT object MUST contain the `iss` property, and its value MUST match the DID URI present in the assertion's outer `did` property value (as noted in step 1 above)
          </li>
          <li>
            The JWT object MUST contain the `domain` property, and its value MUST match the domain the resource was requested from.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JWT object SHOULD contain the `exp` property, and if present, the value MUST be an epoch time that is greater than the current epoch time. If this property is not present, the assertion's future expiry is based on its continued presence in the resource (or its replacement with updated assertion that contains an expiry value).
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all properties in the JWT have been parsed in accordance with the preceding rules, the implementer MUST perform resolution of the DID specified in the `iss` property and validate the signature of the JWT against the authentication material (e.g. public keys) located in resolved DID Document.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note" role="note">
          <p>
            If the resource processing entity is not looking for the presence of a specific DID, or intending to validate a specific DID in `entities` array of Domain Linkage Assertions, the resource processing entity SHOULD iterate the array of Domain Linkage Assertions beginning at 0 index. This normative iteration from 0 index is intended to allow domain controllers to order their Domain Linkage Assertions in accordance with a known processing order, in cases where order may matter to the domain controller. An example of this the case where a domain controller has a primary signing DID that is the likely target of interest for the vast majority of relying parties who seek to validate a credential based on the DIDs associated with a domain via the DID Configuration resource.
